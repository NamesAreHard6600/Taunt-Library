PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENTATION AT THE BEGINNING OF taunt.lua! There's a lot of important information, like dependencies, init info, and other important notes for getthing this working properly. It's a generally hacky library because it has to do with queued attacks, which in the vanila game, never change once made, so there's some extra steps you have to go through ex: custom tooltips. Sorry for any inconvience, I hope it's helpful!
